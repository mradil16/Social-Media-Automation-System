# Streamlined Social Media Automation System

A highly efficient and secure toolkit for social media automation, built with a focus on asynchronous operations to ensure non-blocking I/O and optimal performance.

## üåü Overview

This project provides a robust framework for automating social media posts, with initial support for Twitter. It is designed to be easily extensible for other platforms. The system leverages `asyncio`, `aiosqlite`, and `tweepy` to handle post scheduling, content optimization, and interaction with social media APIs in a fully asynchronous manner. This ensures that the application remains responsive and can handle a high volume of operations without being blocked by I/O tasks.

## ‚ú® Key Features

*   **Asynchronous Core**: Built from the ground up with `asyncio` for high-performance, non-blocking operations.
*   **Twitter Integration**: A ready-to-use, async-compatible `TwitterBot` for posting tweets.
*   **Persistent Scheduling**: Uses an `aiosqlite` database to reliably schedule and manage posts.
*   **Content Optimization**: Includes a basic `ContentOptimizer` to automatically add relevant hashtags to Twitter posts.
*   **Secure Configuration**: Manages API keys and secrets securely through environment variables.
*   **Robust Error Handling**: Implements retry logic and graceful error handling for network requests.
*   **Extensible Design**: The modular structure makes it straightforward to add support for more social media platforms.

## üõ†Ô∏è Getting Started

Follow these steps to get the automation system up and running.

### Prerequisites

*   Python 3.7+
*   An approved Twitter Developer account with v2 API access.

### 1. Clone the Repository

First, clone the repository to your local machine:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/social-media-automation.git
cd social-media-automation
```

### 2. Create the Python File
Save the provided code as `social_media_automation_system.py` in the root of the project directory.

### 3. Install Dependencies
This project relies on a few external libraries. It's recommended to use a virtual environment.

```bash
# Create and activate a virtual environment (optional but recommended)
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows, use `venv\Scripts\activate`

# Install the required packages
pip install tweepy aiosqlite aiohttp python-dotenv
```

### 4. Configure Environment Variables
The system uses environment variables for security. Create a file named `.env` in the root directory of your project and add your Twitter API credentials.

**File: `.env`**
```env
TWITTER_API_KEY="YOUR_API_KEY"
TWITTER_API_SECRET="YOUR_API_SECRET"
TWITTER_ACCESS_TOKEN="YOUR_ACCESS_TOKEN"
TWITTER_ACCESS_TOKEN_SECRET="YOUR_ACCESS_TOKEN_SECRET"
TWITTER_BEARER_TOKEN="YOUR_BEARER_TOKEN"
```
***Note:*** *To have the script automatically load these variables, you will need to add a few lines to the top of `social_media_automation_system.py` to load the `.env` file:*
```python
# Add this to the top of the script with the other imports
from dotenv import load_dotenv
load_dotenv()```

## üöÄ How to Use
The script is pre-configured with examples to demonstrate its functionality.

### Running the Script
To run the script and execute the example immediate and scheduled posts:
```bash
python social_media_automation_system.py
```

You will see output confirming the successful immediate post and the scheduling of two future posts.

### Using the `AutomationEngine`

The `AutomationEngine` is the central component of the system. You can integrate it into your own applications.

#### Initialize the Engine

```python
import asyncio
from social_media_automation_system import AutomationEngine

async def my_app():
    engine = AutomationEngine()
    await engine.initialize()
    # ... your logic here
```

#### Publish a Post Immediately
The `publish_now` method allows you to post content to one or more platforms instantly.
```python
content = "This is a test post sent directly from the automation system!"
results = await engine.publish_now(content, ['twitter'])
print(f"Immediate post results: {results}")```

#### Schedule a Post for Later

The `schedule_post` method saves a post to the database to be published at a future time.

```python
from datetime import datetime, timedelta

# Schedule a post for 1 hour from now
scheduled_time = datetime.now() + timedelta(hours=1)
content = "This post is scheduled to be published in one hour."

post_id = await engine.schedule_post(content, 'twitter', scheduled_time)
print(f"Scheduled post with ID: {post_id}")
```

### Running the Continuous Scheduler
To have the system continuously check for and publish scheduled posts, you can run the scheduler as a long-running service. In the `main()` function of the script, uncomment the final line:
```python
# In main() function of social_media_automation_system.py

        # ... (previous code)

        # Uncomment to run continuous scheduler
        await engine.run_scheduler()
```
Now, when you run the script, it will check for due posts every 5 minutes and publish them automatically until you stop the script (e.g., with `Ctrl+C`).
```bash
python social_media_automation_system.py
```

## üìÇ Project Structure
*   **`social_media_automation_system.py`**: The main file containing all the classes and logic.
    *   **`Post`**: A `dataclass` representing a social media post.
    *   **`ConfigManager`**: Handles loading configuration from environment variables.
    *   **`Database`**: Manages the async `aiosqlite` database for storing and retrieving posts.
    *   **`TwitterBot`**: Handles all interactions with the Twitter API.
    *   **`ContentOptimizer`**: A utility for optimizing content for specific platforms.
    *   **`AutomationEngine`**: The main class that orchestrates all operations.
*   **`automation.db`**: The SQLite database file that is automatically created when the script is run for the first time.
*   **`.env`**: The file where you store your secret API credentials.
